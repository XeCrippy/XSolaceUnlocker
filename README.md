# XSolace Achievement & Avatar Award Unlocker for Xbox 360 RGH/JTAG consoles 

* Set as a dashlaunch plugin (or jrpc.ini)
* Sign into the account you want to use 
* Load the game you want to unlock achievements or avatar awards for
* Press Dpad_Left+X to unlock achievements
* Press Dpad_Left+Y to unlock avatar awards
* A lot of games don't have avatar awards. Usually if it fails that is why but it doesn't make it crash.

# Note:
This plugin does not retrieve the achievementId's so to use the individual achievement unlocker you need to obtain the Ids yourself. Or check out Retro360 below. Its not something i can really do for the plugin because of lack of a UI.
