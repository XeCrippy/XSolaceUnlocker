# XSolace Achievement & Avatar Award Unlocker for Xbox 360 RGH/JTAG consoles 

# I forgot to update the GitHub source to include the gamer pic unlocker but it's in the latest xex release 

* Set as a dashlaunch plugin (or jrpc.ini)
* Sign into the account you want to use 
* Load the game you want to unlock achievements or avatar awards for
* Press Dpad_Left+X to unlock achievements
* Press Dpad_Left+Y to unlock avatar awards
* A lot of games don't have avatar awards. Usually if it fails that is why but it doesn't make it crash.
